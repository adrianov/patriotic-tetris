# Patriotic Tetris TODO

## Current phase
**Phase 6: Themes (UI switcher)**

## Phase 6 tasks

- [x] Update docs (`SPEC.md`, `TODO.md`)

## Next after themes (Phase 7)

- [ ] Verify audio controls + mute work consistently across browsers/devices

## Later (Phase 8)
- [ ] Local high scores (localStorage)
- [ ] Loading/intro screen (optional)
- [ ] Final code review + deployment readiness
